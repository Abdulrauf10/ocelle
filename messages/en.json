    "block-5-mark-2-title": "Overreliance on Carbohydrates & <block>Unnecessary Fillers</block>",
    "block-5-mark-2-content-1": "Many kibble formulas contain a high percentage of carbohydrates, as it<apos10></apos10>s an essential binding agent in the production process.

Common fillers include corn, wheat, soy, and cellulose.",
    "block-5-mark-2-content-3": "While not necessarily harmful, fillers can dilute the overall nutritional quality of food, making it harder to get all the essential nutrients needed for optimal health.

    "block-5-mark-3-content-1": "Kibble is typically produced via extrusion, where ingredients are mixed and cooked under high heat pressure.

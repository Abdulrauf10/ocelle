    "block-5-mark-1-title": "Questionable <block>Protein Sources</block>",
    "block-5-mark-1-content-1": "What counts as a ‘meat’ source in dog food can vary and range in description, due to industry regulation and standard production methods.",
    "block-5-mark-1-content-2": "Whole, ground carcasses, unfit for human consumption may be used, including animals that are sick, diseased, or dying.",
    "block-5-mark-1-content-3": "Some products use unspecified meat by-products or ‘meat meals’, rather than whole, high-quality meat sources. While not inherently harmful, these by-products are often sourced from less desirable parts of animals, like connective tissue, beaks, or bones, and may contain a minimal amount of quality meat.",
    "block-5-mark-2-title": "Overreliance on Carbohydrates & <block>Unnecessary Fillers</block>",
    "block-5-mark-2-content-1": "Many kibble formulas contain a high percentage of carbohydrates, as it’s an essential binding agent in the production process. Unsurprisingly, today’s kibble is estimated to contain ~4 times<sup>10, 11</sup> the carbohydrate content historically found in the canine diet.",
    "block-5-mark-2-content-2": "<b>Carbs can be beneficial for dogs and provide a practical source of energy and fibre, but excessive carbs simply act as a filler.</b> Fillers are ingredients that provide little to no nutritional value to dogs and are primarily used to bulk-up food and reduce production costs. Common fillers include corn, wheat, soy, and cellulose.",
    "block-5-mark-2-content-3": "While not necessarily harmful, fillers can dilute the overall nutritional quality of food, making it harder to get all the essential nutrients needed for optimal health. Excessive use of fillers may also lead to digestive issues and contribute to health problems like obesity, high blood sugar, and food allergies.",
    "block-5-mark-2-content-4": "Grain-free kibble isn’t exempt from this issue either, as ‘grain-free’ doesn’t mean carbohydrate-free. Instead, other carbs like potatoes and legumes will be used in excessively large quantities to ensure the kibble ‘dough’ binds properly.",
    "block-5-mark-3-title": "Overcooked, Less Nutritious, More Artificial",
    "block-5-mark-3-content-1": "Kibble is typically produced via extrusion, where ingredients are mixed and cooked under high heat pressure. Alongside this extrusion process, preservatives are introduced to extend shelf life, while artificial colours and flavour enhancers are often infused to maintain its appeal, ensuring that it remains palatable even after sitting on a shelf for long periods of time.",
    "block-5-mark-3-content-2": "The high heat extrusion method, while effective for mass production, has been shown to reduce protein quality, decrease palatability, destroy essential heat-sensitive vitamins, and even produce compounds known to be carcinogenic.<sup>12-14</sup>",
    "block-5-mark-3-content-3": "To counterbalance the natural nutrients lost during this process, manufacturers artificially add vitamins and minerals in order to meet basic nutritional standards. However, despite these artificial supplement replacements, nutrients in kibble are found to be less digestible and bioavailable compared to nutrients from natural food sources.<sup>15-17</sup>",
    "block-5-mark-3-content-4": "Put simply, less usable nutrition = fewer health benefits.",
    "block-5-mark-4-title": "Lack of Labelling Transparency",
    "block-5-mark-4-content-1": "There's often a lack of transparency about ingredient sources, manufacturing processes, and quality control measures, making it difficult for consumers to make fully-informed choices.<sup>18,19</sup>",
    "block-5-mark-4-content-2": "Labels can also be misleading; for example – the difference between ‘chicken dog food’ and <h>‘dog food <b>with</b> chicken’</h>. While both are advertised as a chicken dish, the <h>latter</h> only needs to contain 3% (AAFCO) or 4% (FEDIAF) chicken to legally make this claim.",
    "block-5-mark-4-content-3": "Additionally, numerous studies have found pet foods containing undisclosed ingredients or even missing those they claim to use.<sup>20-24</sup> In the worst cases, these issues pose a significant health risk to dogs – especially those with underlying health issues.",
    "block-6-title": "How Does Kibble Affect Your Dog?",
    "block-6-content-1": "While it’s irresponsible to say that kibble directly causes X, Y, and Z diseases, many ingredients in kibble have been linked to a range of health issues, with a growing body of research advocating for alternative diet options.",
    "block-6-content-2": "Not all kibble is created equal, and indeed, it serves a purpose in the diverse landscape of canine nutrition. There are commendable brands out there striving to elevate the standards of their products.",
    "block-6-content-3": "Recognizing this, we also firmly believe that every dog deserves nutrition that does more than just satisfy hunger. Just because it’s ‘always been that way’, doesn’t mean it should stay that way. Like any other member of the family, they deserve to be fed properly. That’s why we started OCELLE, to make fresh feeding as easy as possible.",
